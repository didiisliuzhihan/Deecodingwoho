            <p>🧠Reflection:</p>
            <p>Coding is no longer just a language for programmers, more designers, artists or other industries are also involved. When I first came into contact with creative coding, I chose this major with the intention that artists also need to be exposed to the language tools of the new era.</p>
            <p>Coding is a way of expression, just like painting, photography, games, writing and other creative languages. It is also based on the Internet, which allows people to have more diverse access to code works from different brains, so that they can communicate and understand each other. This is a process that is a bit difficult to get started, but it is very interesting.</p>
            <p>Now I think coding is like architecture. It is the bricks and foundation of the Internet world. It also depends on the programmers themselves. Do you want to build a playground for people to have fun, an office building that provides a production platform, or a library for communication and learning? Or a diverse community that includes everything? Everything is possible.</p>

            <h2>🧩Reflection on What I've learned🧩</h2>
            <p>I’m excited to learn creative coding in Professor Lu’s CC LAB!</p>
            <p>This semester, I learned the basic application of JAVA language and p5js, which enabled me to create basic but interesting interactive animations or mini games.</p>
            <p>Before this, as a game writer, although I love designing games and levels, I was very afraid of code!</p>
            <p>I am very happy to have learned how to use computer language to create simple works in Lu’s course this semester. At least I can confidently complete the demo independently in the future!</p>
            <p>Oh wait! Since I left China and my friends, I can use p5js and code to make birthday gifts for these friends!</p>
