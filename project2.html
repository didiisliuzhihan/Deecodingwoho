            <h2>🧩INTRODUCTION🧩</h2>
            <p>You can see that this is a bar chart with the days as units, and the data is measured in the number of times. For example, 'Monday: 7 times' means I farted seven times on Monday. By looking at the height of the bars, you can also see that I farted the most on Saturday—that day I had hot pot and iced milk tea.   </p>
            <p>⚗️Process:</p>
            <p>1️⃣I'm tracking the number of farts in real-time every day.</p>
            <p>2️⃣To highlight the differences and average in the number of farts, I chose a bar chart, which reinforces this purpose.</p>
            <p>3️⃣In the design, I embedded an image and audio—although the image was something I found on Pinterest, the audio was recorded by myself with my mouth, haha!</p>
            <p>4️⃣When coding, I tried using more loops while also avoiding making the visuals too complex.</p>
            <p>----</p>
            <p>🤔What did you learn about yourself through the process of self-tracking?</p>
            <p>I learned that My bad stomach is usually related to what I eat that day. For example, if I eat something too spicy or greasy, I'll fart a lot; eating something too cold also causes it. </p>
