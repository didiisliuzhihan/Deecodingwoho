2. it is a bad rabbit who just killed a poor monster and is holding its head and an eye now;
3. a mashroom is thumbing up for you!

A new background:
Sonic darkened!
He killed a single-eye people on the halloween!!

4. It's totally fun than boring coding assignments~
5. But I feel difficult for the coordinate axis corresponding to the shape; it often spends time a lot.
6. new stuff: To limitate the scope of movement,
