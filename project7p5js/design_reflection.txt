Design Process:
I chose to use the classic Pac-Man game scene, integrating variables such as random().
For the bean firing functionality, I tried learning how to make the bean function by watching YouTube tutorials.
However, I still have many areas where I am uncertain, and the final result didnâ€™t fully match the concept I had in my mind.
I hope to improve my skills in the next class and create the ideal scene concept.

Discovery:
I discovered that with P5.js, I might be able to create a simple game with interactive feedback in the future. Let's see if I can achieve that.
